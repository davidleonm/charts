# Charts
Repository with a set of Helm charts with my favourite applications to be deployed on Kubernetes.

## What is this for
Continuing with my learning path, I decided to create this repository as a place to store a set of Helm charts for the applications I use at home.
With this, I will learn about Kubernetes and Helm, which are things present on my daily basis and what I would like to improve my knowledge about.

## Pre-requisites
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) environment on-premise or [Micro-k8s](https://microk8s.io/). Of course a Kubernetes cluster on the cloud is also suitable in case you can afford it :).
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed on the server and locally in case you want to develop your own charts.

## Applications
### JDownloader
[JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/) is a popular and open-code Java application to download content from Internet such as games, applications and multimedia.
It must not be used to take copyright-protected files.

The chart set here is prepared to store the configuration and content on the host's disk. 

## Change-log
I will not use branching for this project so I will just create tags when I consider a chart is finished. The code will change without further notice so fork or copy it when you need it.

* **v1.0.0** - First version with [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/).

## License
Use this code as you wish! Totally free to be copied/pasted.
## Donation
